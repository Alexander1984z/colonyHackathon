# Hackathon project brainstorming

This document's purpose is merely to demonstrate a few concrete _potential_ ideas that could be submitted for the Colony Hackathon, to give participants a general sense of scope and focus that might otherwise be too vaguely defined.

It does not seek to limit or discourage other ideas or projects that might be entirely different from those described below, nor do the examples given represent ideas or projects that will be favored by judges in any way if created by a participant in the event.


## UX / Design ideas

* Reputation visualizer.

* Gantt Chart visualizer for tasks.

## Front-end / Dapp ideas

* Trusty super-tasks.

* Export to CSV tool.

## Extension and Integration ideas

* Slackbot integration for colony events.

* Tipping bot.

## colonyNetwork contract-level ideas

* Task rating based on events from an external contract.
